# personal-msds
This repository is dedicated to my personal MSDS semester 1. The courses in this semester are customized according to my needs. The aim of the **#personalMSDS** is to upgrade skills without formally enrolling into a Master's program at a University. Majority of the content that would be used in this **#personalMSDS** is easily available online through YouTube and Coursera. Most of the topics revolve around Mathematics, Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, AWS Cloud Services, and Big Data. Each semester revolves around a particular domain; each semester contains a hand-full of languages, frameworks and libraries
